Syriac Studies is a website whose key objective is to shed new light on Syriac culture, which historically originated and flourished in ancient Syro-Mesopotamia, but its impact was felt in every corner of the Near East and as far as China. This website is intended to pay homage to Syriac heritage, exploring its salient aspects and focusing on disciplines as diverse as literature, theology, philosophy, history, science, and medicineÎíÎñfields in which the Arameans/Syrians excelled and to which they made an important contribution.

Striving to help the viewers have a comprehensive and objective knowledge of Syriac culture, the board of Syriac Studies pledges to provide the viewers with scholarly articles and books representing a wide spectrum of opinions. The website, hopefully, will turn into a platform for international writers, scholars, and researchers to air their views about Syriac culture.
